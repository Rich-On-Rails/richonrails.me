### So, why a User Manual? ...

This document is a quick tour of my personality, values and quirks! It's purpose is to help others better understand me and get the most from our interactions.

### Pronouns

He/Him

### Languages

English

### Time zone

[GMT](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/uk/london) 

### Preferred method of communication

- I like to communicate using asynchronous methods, we don't need a meeting for everything. 

- For most things, Discord or Email work best for me, I am not a big talker on the telephone.

- If we do need a video call for whatever reason, I prefer to use teams. 

### How I Work

- Any meetings I need to attend should where possible be accompanied with an agenda so that I can adequately plan. 

- I have two set times in each day where I check emails, these are between 7-8:30am & 7-8:30pm. 

- I would like to request that I can close teams for periods of time during my working day when I don't have meetings. As I am predominantly on site if someone wants to speak to me they can come to my desk? 

- Where possible please give advanced warning before cancelling meetings. Surprise changes to my schedule cause anxiety. 

- Please be clear on concise when requesting work from me, provide as much detail as possible. 

- I take regular breaks to re-focus. For every 30 minutes I work I take a 5 minute break, meaning for every 60 minutes worked I get 10 minutes total break time. 

- I already have a task list of my day(s), if you have something that needs to fit into that lets discuss it, please try not to land things on me out of the blue.

- I like to have regular catchups, this gives me the ability to feedback how things are going for me and for you to feedback to me on how the working relationship is going. 

### What to expect from me

- I can when working on something that has high reward be hyper focussed, I will spend longer than I should working on that piece of work, this would in turn make me extremely tired, if you notice me doing this, please suggest I take a break.

- I get upset easily when my day is changed or my routine is amended without given prior warning.
